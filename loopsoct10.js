//Loops: 

//1.FizzBuzz Problem: 

//Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". 

//For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". 

//2.Factorial: 

//Write a for loop to find the factorial of a number n. For example, if n = 5, the result should be 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. 

//3.Sum of Multiples: 

//Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. 

//4.Count Vowels in a String: 

//Write a loop to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string. 

//Break and Continue: 

//5.Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips the number 5 using the continue statement. Stop the loop entirely when the number reaches 8 using 

//the break statement.
